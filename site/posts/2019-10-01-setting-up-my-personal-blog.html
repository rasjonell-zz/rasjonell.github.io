As I had previously used the services of <a href="https://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> and <a href="http://namecheap.com">NameCheap</a> I decided to go with <a href="https://get.tech">GetTech</a>.</p><p>Fortunately <code class="inline">rasjonell.tech</code> was not taken and with a couple of clicks the domain was mine.
Apart from the fact the UI/UX for the Admin Area is horrendous, GetTech provides a number of cool <em>free</em> services. These include:</p><ul><li>Email Service (with OX App Suite Webmail)
</li><li>Domain Forwarding
</li><li>DNS Management
</li></ul><h2 id="creating-the-blog">Creating the blog</h2><p>I didn‚Äôt have time to create something of my own so I had to look for help from the community. There are a lot(actually more then necessary) of static site generators. There was no way I was going to use any JS ‚Äúpowered‚Äù tool so I narrowed down my options to only three SSGs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/BennyHallett/obelisk">Obelisk</a></li><li><a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">SSG by Roman Zolotarev</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Dalgona/Serum">Serum</a></li></ul><p>As a huge fan of <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> I looked for projects written in Elixir to possibly contribute and have a rest from the JavaScripts I have to deal with every day. Obelisk was the first thing I found, however going to the issues tab on GitHub I found this:</p><p><img src="/media/obelisk_issue.png" alt="Obelisk Issue"/></p><p>So I had to make a choice between SSG and Serum. Writing this I figured out that there is no rational(or should I say <em>rasjonell</em> ü§î) reason for choosing any other software instead of SSG but my love for declarative programming and good ol‚Äô memories of ruby-ish syntax made me choose Serum.</p><p>Setting up the project was as straightforward as it could be. You download the software, compile it and there you go. I also installed a custom theme, for which I had to change a single line in my config file(I‚Äôm thinking of forking this theme to add a dark mode). Refer to the <a href="https://dalgona.github.io/Serum/getting-started.html">official guide</a> for more detailed introduction.</p><h2 id="hosting-the-blog">Hosting the blog</h2><p>Unlike my experience with choosing a static site generator, hosting was an easy and obvious decision. I used to use a number of hosting services and was mostly happy with <a href="https://zeit.co">Zeit‚Äôs</a> ‚Äú0-config deployments‚Äù, until I actually needed to config my deployment. That‚Äôs when I faced an issue, didn‚Äôt care enough to investigate it and moved to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. I just magically lived happily ever after.</p><p>Serum produces a static HTML/CSS website so you can just <code class="inline">netlify deploy site</code>. That‚Äôs it. Problem solved.</p><h2 id="automating-the-blog">Automating the blog</h2><p>I already had a personal website hosted on Github so I just abandoned it and force pushed this newer, better one. But I didn‚Äôt want to manually build and the deploy the site every time I made changes so I set up git hooks with <a href="https://github.com/sds/overcommit">overcommit</a> to run <code class="inline">mix serum.build</code> before pushing the code.</p><p>After that I configured my Netlify(‚ù§Ô∏è) project to automatically build from the master branch of my repo.</p><p>All of this is already cool enough and I really enjoyed making it. But I was thinking of making a local CMS-like environment where you just have a rich text editor and a couple of cool looking buttons for publishing or perhaps saving your blog-post as draft. However I couldn‚Äôt justify this need and didn‚Äôt make it. If you think it‚Äôll be cool to have such a tool or have any ideas or suggestions contact me on <a href="https://xn--69aa8bzb.xn--y9a3aq/@gurgen">Mastodon</a> or just email me@rasjonell.tech</p></div></article></main>
